# FFXIV ACT Installer
The goal of this project to make installing and setting up ACT and the overlay plugin as simple and straightfoward as possible. This installer will take you from nothing to a mini-parse displaying on first launch of ACT with zero configuration required.

By default, the installer:
* Combines pet and owner damage
* Simulates dot crits
* Sets encounter culling to 30 seconds
* Automatically finds and uses both the FFXIV_ACT_Plugin and the Overlay Plugin from Hibiysleep

If desired, Cactbot can also be installed, though the timeline is not set up by default.

Any suggestions are welcome.
